## A World Without Work by Ryan Avent

The world is not ready for jobs to be taken away from a future without jobs, let alone the digital
revolution

Income inequality increases as people clamor for low paying jobs due to mechanical competition

They will need to be given money but how?
- Basic Income (However, workers would like some sort of a purpose over a hand out
- Minimum Wage increases (However, this pushes workers out of the workforce)
- Wage Subsidies
- Lump sum of capital at birth
- The eventual necessity for man to find meaning without work Those that give must be coerced in
  large social change just as the recipients
- Qualification to receive money
- A reason to part with their money (47% give no federal income tax)
	- One way that works today is giving to those that are similar **tribesman**

**It is our time to start this process through social and political reform**

## The Paradox Of Robots Taking all Our Jobs by Adam Ozimek

Humans have been displaced by jobs already like farmers and tractors

Job displacement allows for humans to fill positions not displaced

We will be able to complement furthermore AI will train us better than us

Machines will be able to help man reach his highest potential

**Paradox: robots make humans less obsolete through superior education** *this includes parenting*

However, I disagree due to human bottlenecking

## Talk to Each Other, Not Your Phone by Sherry Turkle

Sherry's former article "Reclaiming Conversation" argued direct engagement is needed for empathy

*Side Note* - Sherry uses the word hum to describe online connection just as the book does

Joseph Middleton argued that, in reality, most human interaction is dull and if you are interesting
all your interactions will be interesting, regardless of the medium. Sherry retorts saying treating
conversation transactionally like this causes a lack of empathy to begin with as it stops
spontaneity and natural conversing

Sherry has talked to Randall a 24 year old that explained that lulls in conversation allow for quick
check ups of media facets 

Randall feels pressure to hold information of value for conversation.

Alternatively, Sallie McKenna tells us the importance of the "spaces between things" to process
information

Boring compared to discomfort to stillness (*or a hum perhaps*)

Zvi, a college Junior worries he lacks the ability to converse with Professors and instead e-mails
them due to transactional thinking

## A Hot Trend: The Internet, Social Media & The Elderly

The elderly use the internet (71%) and social media (34%) to bridge the gap with loved ones,
decreasing isolation. It is a gateway to the outside, inaccessible world

Rather than focusing on individualism, the elderly connect with like minded people (*old people
tribes baby*)

Healthcare and sympathy are now available at their fingertips

Elderly people can learn at physical locations or, those home bound, can find stimulating internet
courses. A small study has shown this keeps the elderly keen.

The article finishes by saying

> Overcoming loneliness is that much easier through the Internet and social media.
